RGB Colour Guessing Game
=====================

RGB Colour Guessing Game is a game built using front-end vanilla JS in which users can practice identifying RGB colours from a grid.

### Usage

The user has two game options: easy - where they are presented with 3 possibilities, and hard - where they have 6 squares to choose from. When the user clicks on the correct colour, all squares change to that colour. If the user clicks on the wrong colour, the square fades away.
